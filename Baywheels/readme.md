# Ford Bay Wheels Data for May 2020
## by Maciej Socha


## Dataset

> GoBike dataset was explored in this document. I have analyzed May 2020 data. Dataset contains over 130 000 rent records. There is few thousand records with empty data for start/ end stations, but as they were not needed to my analysis I decided to leave them. Few of the columns were of incorrect types. I had to add time difference columns to properly find out rent periods.



## Summary of Findings

    - almost 93% of the rents are shorter than 1 hour
    - Registered users are responsible for almost 39% of rents
    - Most popular days to rent are Friday, Saturday and Sunday
    - Most popular hours to rent are between 15 - 18
    - Longest rents are between 13 - 15

## Key Insights for Presentation

    - Peaks in rents are mostly shared with weekends and late afternoon rents
    - Members are more constisten with their rents
